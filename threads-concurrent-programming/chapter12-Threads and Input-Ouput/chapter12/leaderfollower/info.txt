LEADER-FOLLOWER PATTERN

 The design pattern of this example is known as the leader-follower pattern. It relies on the fact
 that only one thread can execute the accept() method; that is, the internal implementation of the
 accept() method is synchronized. The thread that obtains that lock can establish the connection with a
 client and obtain that client's data socket. It can then release the lock, and the next thread in line
 then obtains the lock and processes the next client.
