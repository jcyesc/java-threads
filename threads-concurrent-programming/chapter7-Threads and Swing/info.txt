Threads and Swing

Summary
The Swing classes comprise one of the largest set of classes in the Java API. While threads are 
an integral part of Java, the Swing classes themselves are not threadsafe. This places a responsibility 
on the developer, who must make sure that she follows the appropriate access patterns for Swing classes. 
Methods on Swing objects (with a few exceptions) can be invoked only on the event-dispatching thread.

Swing's use of the invokeLater() method gives us a hint about how we might handle thread-unsafe libraries 
in general: as long as access to those libraries occurs only on a single thread, we will not run into any 
threading problems. Passing a Runnable object to a thread pool that contains a single thread is precisely 
analogous to the technique used by the Swing classes.

Example Classes

Here are the class names for the examples in this chapter:

Description											Main Java class

Swing Type Tester (all components threadsafe)		chapter7.examples1.SwingTypeTester
Swing Type Tester (uses invokeAndWait)				chapter7.example2.SwingTypeTester
Swing Type Tester with simulated server connection	chapter7.example3.SwingTypeTester
